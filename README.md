## My process
When building this project, I first started with the structure of the page. Then I began styliing using CSS. Once the design aestheic was met, I went ahead and started playing around with the paddings, margins and flexbox to figure out the layout for the web page. I usually start with the easiest tasks first like HTML, and then move on to the more difficult ones which is figuring out the layout for the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### Continued development

Although this is a Junior level project, I still found this one a bit challenging. This project has taken me a while to build even though it is incomplete. I have not done the Mobile friendly part for this project which is where I need to improve my skills. I have tried all kinds of code and still cannnot get it the way it's supposed to look.

This project has made me realize that I still need to work on improving my HTML and CSS skills mainly.  I am still having a hard time figuring out how to payout a webpage using Flexbox and grid. Especially is the webpage has alot of content.
